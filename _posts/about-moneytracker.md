## Introducing MoneyTracker!

Moneytracker is a dead-simple asset tracking app, born out of my want to see my 'total net-worth' in a
single place. As someone that holds assets in different places like banks, crypto wallets, and crypto
exchanges, the lack of a single place to view all my assets was getting frustrating.

A quick feature overview:
- Track your assets in different _Holding Entities_ (eg. a bank account, a crypto wallet, etc) and view your net-worth in a single currency
- Support for multiple fiat and crytpo currencies
- Import/Export data across different devices
- Privacy mode to hide your net-worth from prying eyes
- Mobile friendly - You can use it on the go!

**Quick note:** The data that MoneyTracker uses currently exists only on your local device, and I don't get to see any of your data.
The data is not stored on any server/database as well.
However, I'm planning to expand MoneyTracker to more of a 'crypto portfolio' style of app, where you can see the value of your assets in real-time,
as well as the performance of your assets over time. In my head right now, this would necessitate the use of a server/database to store your data,
however, this is subject to change.

### How do I use MoneyTracker?
**Adding Holding Entities and Assets**

With Moneytracker, you can simply add a 'Holding Entity' (eg. a crypto wallet) and then add different assets under it (
eg. BTC, ETH, etc).

**Import/Export Data**

Click on `Settings` in the header. If you want to _export_ your data, you can simply copy the text in the text area and import it in
another browser running MoneyTracker.
